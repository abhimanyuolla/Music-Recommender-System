# Music-Recommender-System

Future mobile devices are based on on heterogeneous multiprocessing platforms accommodating several stand-alone applications. In many ways, embedded devices have always operated autonomously, the difference is that they have also been largely stationary. Nevertheless, the practices used to develop embedded applications in general, and embedded software in particular, reflect the nature of embedded devices. The design challenges faced in development of embedded systems are usually related to device networking. Platform designer needs abstract application models for defining platform computation and communication capacities. 
I have proposed a layered UML application and Python platform modelling approach that allows application and platform to be modelled at several levels of abstraction, from creating a database phase to all the way to having a recall and precision account which enables early performance evaluation of the resulting system. The overall approach will be experimented with a Music Recommendation System, which uses a Content based and a Collaborative based filtering techniques to provide the user with a recommendation to a new song.
